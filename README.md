# `kubectl community-images`

`kubectl` `community-images` is a `kubectl` plugin that displays images running in a Kubernetes cluster that were pulled from community owned repositories and warn the user to switch repositories if needed

## What does the output look like

## How it Works

The plugin will iterate through readable namespaces, and look for pods. For every pod it can read, the plugin will read the `podspec` for the container images, and any `init` container images. Additionally, it collects the content sha of the image, so that it can be used to disambiguate between different versions pushed with the same tag.

Once there is a list of images, the plugin will print those images that come from a community owned repository and specifically point out those whose repository path have to be updated
